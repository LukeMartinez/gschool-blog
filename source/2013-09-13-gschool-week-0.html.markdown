My first week at gSchool has been a humbling experience. The challenges I face every day require a lot of patience, and creativity. I look forward to a time when I understand why the code I am writing works. I also look forward to having an understanding of the Ruby language that will allow me to be creative with the projects/tutorials I am working on.
